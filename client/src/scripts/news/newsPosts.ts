        content: `We here at H.A.Z.E.L have broadened our horizons, and expanded operations to a new island! DMR's and snipers reign supreme in the savannah! But settlement operations have been delayed... indefinitely. Which leads to houses being an impossible find here...<br><br>

We've also began experimenting with a new, lighter form of transporting oil, the propane tank! These tiny barrels are convenient for transporting oil due to the scarcity of oil on this island. But their smaller size means they could theoretically be exploded much easier than regular barrels...<br><br>

*End transmission*<br><br>
"We have some bad news. During transportation the flint crate was... damaged to say the least. But I know the combatants won't assume anything out of the ordinary.."`,
